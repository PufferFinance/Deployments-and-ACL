Puffer Protocol Upgrade (v1.1) is a minor upgrade that introduces the `AVSContractsRegistry` contract. This post will cover the details of the upgrade and the changes that are made.

**Upgrade Transaction**: [Safe TX #82](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb050f16545576048e94ed0021ec3adb4602caa5b2e732c706dea3c0a59e93bda)


# Upgrade Overview
The Puffer contracts were designed with a future-oriented mindset. One decision was to introduce `RestakingOperator` contracts to use smart contract operators instead of EOA-controlled operators to allow for DAO automation in the future for restaking-related activities. 

Unfortunately, lack of standardization across the AVS ecosystem has created friction when attempting to opt `RestakingOperator` contracts in to AVSs. Particularly, the AVSs that did not support the same interface as `EigenDA.registerOperator` have not been supported by Puffer operators. 

The purpose of the upgrade is to modify `PufferModuleManager` and `RestakingOperator` contracts to be able to opt in to non-standard AVSs. This is accomplished by introducing generic functions `PufferModuleManager.customExternalCall` and `RestakingOperator.customCalldataCall` to allow the contracts to call any AVS registration interface. Despite these contracts not owning any assets, we wished to add guardrails around which functions can be called. The `AVSContractsRegistry` contract adds these restrictions by requiring the DAO call `AVSContractsRegistry.setAvsRegistryCoordinator` to whitelist the function selectors that are allowed to be called via this pattern.

The goal is to deprecate these contract functions in the future in favor of a standardized AVS registration interface.

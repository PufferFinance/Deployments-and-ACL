- A validator can register


## Lessons Learned, in no particular order

- Always make sure your Testnet/Holesky contracts match your Mainnet contracts. This is a good way to catch bugs early in the backend and the UI, or just not waste time debugging the launch, when the issue is that the contract ABIs are different.

- Always make sure your multisig transaction, that took you effort to get signed, is broadcasted with enough gas, not to run out of gas or the [63_64 issue](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-150.md), and make sure it is executed by one of the owners of the multisig.

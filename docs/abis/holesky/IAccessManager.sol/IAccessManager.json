It is possible to choose the timestamp at which the operation becomes executable as long as it satisfies the execution delays required for the caller. The special value zero will automatically set the earliest possible time. Returns the `operationId` that was scheduled. Since this value is a hash of the parameters, it can reoccur when the same parameters are used; if this is relevant, the returned `nonce` can be used to uniquely identify this scheduled operation from other occurrences of the same `operationId` in invocations of {execute} and {cancel}. Emits a {OperationScheduled} event. NOTE: It is not possible to concurrently schedule more than one operation with the same `target` and `data`. If this is necessary, a random byte can be appended to `data` to act as a salt that will be ignored by the target contract if it is using standard Solidity ABI encoding."},"setGrantDelay(uint64,uint32)":{"details":"Update the delay for granting a `roleId`.
